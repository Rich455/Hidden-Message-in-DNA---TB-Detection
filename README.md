## DNA Motif Detection in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
This project applies bioinformatics algorithms (Greedy Motif Search & Randomized Motif Search) to find conserved DNA motifs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes

What does this mean?
DNA motifs are short recurring patterns in the genome. They often act as:
Regulatory switches that turn TB genes on or off
Markers of drug resistance (e.g., mutations near resistance genes)
Targets for diagnostics or new drugs

How it works
Input = DNA sequences from M. tuberculosis samples
The algorithm searches for the most conserved short sequence (motif) across all samples
Output = A set of motifs that appear consistently in TB genomes

Example output;-

Best Motifs Found:
Sequence 1: GATGA (position 10, score 0)
Sequence 2: GATGA (position 10, score 0)
Sequence 3: GATGA (position 10, score 0)
Sequence 4: GATGA (position 10, score 0)
Sequence 5: GATGA (position 10, score 0)
Consensus Sequence: GATGA


Why is this useful in medicine?

Helps researchers understand TB biology by finding hidden “genetic messages”
May identify drug resistance signatures, guiding better treatment
Could support diagnostic test development by targeting conserved motifs
Contributes to precision medicine by linking genomic patterns with clinical outcomes.
